#########################################################################################

                                    Abstract
Transportation is a day to day need; people use transportation every day to
commute from one place to another. There are different modes of transportation
which include cars, vans, cycle etc. Any mode of transportation is not completely
safe, it depends on the safety of the roads without which accidents are bound to
happen. Accidents will lead to severe damage to property, it can also lead to
death or disablement of people. Also, the amount of loss in terms of accidental
costs the government must incur is also very high. Hence it is important that the
Government and concerned authorities of the state improve the safety of the roads.
With huge amount of data available it has become easy for analysis through vast
improvements in the field of Big Data and Machine Learning. This project talks
about analysis of road accidents in the United Kingdom. Each of the datasets
sourced from different websites are analysed to understand the various reasons
contributing towards accidents. From the results attained we can conclude that the
Government of United Kingdom (UK) has tend to safety of the roads by investing
money in improving the road safety infrastructure. Through further examination
on the data at hand, we can see that the Government has not completely adhered
to fixing the problems reported by the people therefore a proposal can be made
to focus on increasing the problem fixed and that the increase in sale of cars and
motorcycles has not resulted in increase of accidents over the years in UK.
